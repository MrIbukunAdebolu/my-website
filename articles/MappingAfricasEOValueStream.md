# The Earth Observation Value Stream in Africa: From Data to Development and Economic Impact

<sub><i>Disclaimer: This text was generated by Google Gemini.</i></sub>

## 1. Executive Summary

The Earth Observation (EO) value stream in Africa is evolving from dependency to strategic autonomy. This report outlines how raw satellite data is transformed into socioeconomic value across three stages: upstream (data acquisition), midstream (processing), and downstream (application). Key findings include:

- The main barrier is not data scarcity but the challenge of converting raw data into actionable insights.
- Platforms offering Analysis-Ready Data (ARD) and cloud-based tools are democratizing access.
- 94% of EO’s economic and social value is realized in downstream sectors like agriculture and urban planning.
- Multi-stakeholder collaboration and continental policies are essential for a sustainable EO ecosystem.

## 2. Introduction: The Strategic Imperative of EO for Africa

EO is central to Africa’s development goals, aligning with:

- **African Space Policy and Strategy (2016)**
- **STISA 2024**
- **Agenda 2063**
- **UN SDGs**, especially SDG 2 (food security)

The EO value stream comprises:

- **Upstream**: Data acquisition from satellites and sensors
- **Midstream**: Data processing and analysis
- **Downstream**: Application in sectors like agriculture, water, and urban planning

## 3. Upstream Value Stream: Data Acquisition and Infrastructure

Africa employs a dual-track strategy:

- **Indigenous satellite development** (e.g., NigeriaSat, SumbandilaSat)
- **Leveraging international data** (e.g., Copernicus, Landsat)
