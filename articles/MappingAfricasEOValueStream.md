# **The Earth Observation Value Stream in Africa: From Data to Development and Economic Impact**

### **1\. Executive Summary**

The Earth Observation (EO) value stream in Africa is a dynamic and complex ecosystem, transitioning from a state of dependence to one of strategic self-determination. This report deconstructs the process by which raw satellite data is transformed into tangible socioeconomic value, from data acquisition and processing to its application in critical sectors. The analysis reveals that the African EO landscape is characterized by a pragmatic, two-track approach: the deliberate development of indigenous space capabilities alongside the strategic leveraging of international public and private data sources. A central finding is that the most significant barrier to value realization is not the lack of data itself, but rather the "midstream" challenge of converting vast, raw datasets into actionable information. This bottleneck is being addressed by a transformative shift toward analysis-ready data (ARD) and cloud-based platforms, which democratize access and lower the technical and financial barriers to entry. The ultimate value of this ecosystem, however, is overwhelmingly realized in "downstream" applications, with an estimated 94% of the total economic and social benefit derived from sectors like agriculture, water management, and urban planning. The strength of this system lies in a coordinated, multi-stakeholder approach, as evidenced by continental policies and collaborative initiatives, which are essential for fostering a robust and sustainable EO market. This report synthesizes these findings to provide a comprehensive map of the value stream, offering key recommendations for policymakers and investors to accelerate the continent's journey toward a more prosperous, sustainable, and resilient future.

### **2\. Introduction: The Strategic Imperative of Earth Observation for Africa**

The integration of Earth Observation technologies is not merely a technical pursuit for Africa; it is a strategic imperative directly linked to the continent's long-term development aspirations. The African Union's comprehensive African Space Policy and Strategy, adopted in January 2016, provides a foundational framework for this effort.1 This policy is a key mechanism for implementing the Science, Technology and Innovation Strategy (STISA 2024), which seeks to address continental priorities and realize the aspirations of Agenda 2063\.2 Explicitly, the policy aims to initiate and build space capabilities in Earth Observation, navigation, and communications to respond to the social, economic, political, and environmental needs of the continent.3 This aligns with Agenda 2063’s focus on core economic pillars such as agriculture, natural and water resources, and digital infrastructure.2 Furthermore, the applications of EO data are instrumental in achieving key international frameworks, including the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 2, which aims to enhance food security and promote sustainable agriculture.5

To comprehend how this strategic vision is translated into practice, it is necessary to deconstruct the EO process into a clear value stream. This stream can be conceptualized in three interconnected stages. The "Upstream" stage involves data acquisition, which is the foundational process of gathering raw information from space-borne, aerial, and in-situ platforms.2 This raw data is then channeled to the "Midstream" stage, where it undergoes processing and analysis to be transformed from a complex collection of pixels into usable, actionable information.6 Finally, the "Downstream" stage is where this information is applied to inform decisions, solve real-world problems, and generate tangible socioeconomic value for governments, industries, and civil society.6

A critical finding in the analysis of this value stream is the highly disproportionate distribution of value. While the entire process is essential, the research indicates that the vast majority of economic and social value is realized in the downstream applications.6 A study by the World Economic Forum and Deloitte estimates that approximately 94% of the potential value added from Earth data by 2030 will come from downstream applications in key industries such as agriculture, utilities, and government services.6 This re-evaluation of value distribution is crucial for understanding investment priorities. It suggests that a nation or organization can achieve the overwhelming majority of benefits by investing heavily in the midstream and downstream—in data processing platforms and user-facing solutions—even without the immense capital expenditure of launching its own satellites. This pragmatic approach of focusing on where the most value is generated is a core principle of the continent’s EO strategy.

### **3\. The Foundational Layer: Data Acquisition and Infrastructure (Upstream Value Stream)**

The foundational layer of the African EO value stream is built upon a dual-track strategy of indigenous capability development and strategic reliance on international resources. African nations are actively investing in launching their own satellites to build sovereign capacity and technical expertise. South Africa, for example, has launched SumbandilaSat, while Nigeria has developed and launched satellites such as NigeriaSat-1 and NigeriaSat-2.10 Egypt leads the continent in the number of satellite launches, and other nations like Ghana, Kenya, and Rwanda have also sent satellites into orbit.11 Many of these indigenous projects involve smaller CubeSats and are often part of international educational collaborations, which are crucial for building human capacity in a cost-effective manner.11

Concurrently, the African EO ecosystem is strategically leveraging a wealth of international assets. It is heavily reliant on free and open-access data from global public programs such as Europe's Copernicus and the United States' Landsat missions.13 This data provides a vast, decades-long archive of information at no cost, which is essential for developing and validating long-term applications. Additionally, the ecosystem utilizes high-resolution commercial imagery from providers like Worldview, GeoEye, and Pléiades for more granular, specialized applications.13 This deliberate combination of building sovereign capabilities while complementing them with accessible international data represents a rational and efficient approach to securing access to critical information. The African Space Policy acknowledges this by stating that the continent will "not reinvent the wheel" but will build its capabilities in a coordinated and effective manner.2 The emphasis is on the value of the data itself, regardless of its origin, and on the rapid development of applications that can use it.

The physical infrastructure for data reception—the ground segment—is another critical component of the upstream value stream. African nations have established a network of ground stations and data centers to collect and process satellite data. South Africa, for instance, operates the South African National Space Agency (SANSA) ground station at Hartebeesthoek, which is a key facility for receiving and archiving data from various international and local satellites.10 Other notable stations and centers include a satellite ground station in Arzew, Algeria; a satellite operation center in Abuja, Nigeria; and an Earth Observation Centre in Ghana.12 The Regional Centre for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD) in Nairobi, Kenya, also serves as a key regional hub for geospatial activities.12 Beyond national efforts, international commercial networks like KSAT have ground stations in Africa, such as the mid-latitude network in South Africa, to reduce data latency for clients.19 The importance of data archives cannot be overstated; SANSA’s portfolio, for instance, includes satellite imagery dating back to 1972, providing a historical record that is invaluable for long-term environmental monitoring and trend analysis.13

### **4\. Bridging the Gap: Data Processing and Platforms (Midstream Value Stream)**

A central challenge in the African EO value stream is the significant gap between the availability of raw data and its practical application. While satellites from global programs like Copernicus and Landsat provide vast amounts of data, a fundamental problem persists: the immense time, cost, and technical expertise required to transform raw satellite imagery into actionable information.8 The primary barriers hindering this process are inadequate computing infrastructure, a lack of high-capacity servers and data centers, limited and costly bandwidth, and a shortage of specialists who can process and interpret the data.8 This data-to-information gap creates a bottleneck that prevents many potential users, particularly in rural or resource-limited settings, from harnessing the full power of EO. For example, a single set of satellite images may need to be processed over 40 times by different users, consuming weeks or months of resources on redundant tasks.21

To address this critical bottleneck, a transformative shift is occurring toward providing Analysis-Ready Data (ARD) and cloud-based platforms. Digital Earth Africa (DE Africa) is a leading example of this approach. It provides a continental-scale, analysis-ready service using the Open Data Cube (ODC) framework, which hosts preprocessed satellite data ready for immediate analysis.20 This eliminates the time-consuming and redundant preprocessing stage, allowing users to move directly to application development and analysis. The ODC also makes decades of historical data, such as a 40-year archive of Landsat imagery, accessible in a structured way that does not require expensive local computational infrastructure.21 The emergence of cloud-based platforms like Dunia further accelerates this trend. Developed in collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA), Dunia is optimized for low-bandwidth environments and mobile devices, making it accessible even in remote areas where traditional platforms would fail.8 It features a web-based "Sandbox" that offers users a virtual development environment with the latest EO tools, circumventing the need for users to install and maintain heavy software on their local devices.22

This shift to cloud-based, ARD platforms represents a fundamental democratization of EO technology. By removing the barriers of high cost and technical complexity, these platforms level the playing field, enabling a wider range of users—from policymakers and researchers to grassroots organizations and small businesses—to access and utilize EO data.21 This transition empowers a broader user base to innovate and create value, which is where the vast majority of the socioeconomic benefit is realized. The new model lowers the financial barrier to entry by shifting the cost from large, one-time capital expenditures (Capex) on physical infrastructure to more manageable, ongoing operational expenditures (Opex), a trend that is also seen in the rise of the "as-a-service" business model in the African space industry.24

The midstream value stream is also fortified by a network of collaborative frameworks that serve as catalysts for capacity building and resource coordination. The African Group on Earth Observations (AfriGEO) operates as a coordination body, linking institutions and agencies across the continent to leverage existing capabilities and minimize duplication of effort.25 It serves as a platform for Africa's participation in the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS), fostering knowledge sharing and global collaboration.25 Complementing this, initiatives like the GMES & Africa and EO Africa R\&D programs, which are partnerships between the African Union and European entities like the ESA, are designed to enhance the capacity of African institutions to utilize EO technologies for sustainable development.26 These programs offer modern cloud computing tools, digital resources, and seed funding to support research efforts, addressing the expertise gap and fostering a dynamic research community.27 Regional centers, such as the Regional Centre for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD) and the AGRHYMET Regional Centre, serve as critical implementing partners for these initiatives, acting as technical hubs that facilitate the flow of information and provide direct support to affiliated countries.20

### **5\. Realizing Impact: Downstream Applications and Value Generation**

The true measure of a robust EO value stream lies in its downstream applications, where data is translated into tangible benefits and economic growth. Earth Observation is not an isolated industry; its value is realized by driving efficiencies, informing decisions, and creating new opportunities in a wide range of other sectors, which constitute the main economic drivers of the African EO market.6

In the critical sector of **Sustainable Agriculture and Food Security**, EO serves as a vital tool for addressing food insecurity and improving agricultural productivity.5 For example, satellite imagery has been used to predict locust breeding grounds in regions near the Sahara, enabling authorities to intervene and save large areas of farmland.26 Remote sensing data provides early warnings for drought and can monitor crop conditions, vegetation health, and pest and disease outbreaks, which are crucial for enhancing decision-making and risk management for farmers and policymakers.5 South Africa’s agricultural sector, one of the most advanced on the continent, is leveraging these technologies to enhance its resilience to economic and meteorological unpredictability.9

EO also offers powerful solutions for **Water Resource and Environmental Management**, addressing issues of water scarcity and transboundary water challenges.29 Satellite data provides a continuous, reliable, and politically neutral source of information, which is particularly valuable for improving data transparency and facilitating cooperation in shared river basins.29 Specific applications include monitoring lakes, reservoirs, and wetlands, as well as mapping floodplains and assessing water quality.13 Initiatives like the ESA's TIGER-NET project have developed the Water Observation and Information System (WOIS) to provide African water authorities with tools to monitor and assess water resources using satellite data.31

The continent's rapid urbanization presents a complex set of challenges that EO is uniquely equipped to address. In **Urban and Infrastructure Development**, satellite data is used to monitor land use changes and track urban growth.13 High-resolution imagery helps city planners identify informal settlements, monitor infrastructure development projects, and ensure compliance with zoning regulations.13 Thermal sensors from EO satellites can identify urban heat islands, enabling targeted interventions to optimize cooling strategies and improve urban heat resilience.17 The city of eThekwini, South Africa, provides a compelling case study on the use of a Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI) system to monitor informal settlements.33 This application, which integrates AI with spatial data, offers benefits like enhanced accuracy and time efficiency.33 The deployment of this system, however, highlights the need to address not just the technical requirements but also the ethical, social, and legal implications of technology adoption.33 This demonstrates that the true value of EO is inseparable from its governance and the need for frameworks that ensure fairness, accountability, and user trust.

Finally, in **Disaster Management and Humanitarian Aid**, EO is an essential tool for both proactive planning and reactive response. Satellite data is used for flood mapping and early warning systems, as seen in the work of the RCMRD.18 It can also be used for fire scar mapping and tracking the progress of fires, as demonstrated by SANSA’s capabilities.13 This type of data is critical for post-event analysis to assess damage and guide humanitarian relief efforts.6

| Application Area | Key Sector(s) | Value Created |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Crop Yield Monitoring | Agriculture, Food Security | Enhanced food security, improved agricultural planning, informed resource allocation 5 |
| Water Body Monitoring | Water Resource Management, Environment | Better management of transboundary water resources, reduced conflict, improved drought and flood preparedness 21 |
| Urban Growth Mapping | Urban Planning, Infrastructure | More efficient management of urban expansion, identification of informal settlements, and optimized infrastructure development 13 |
| Disaster Risk Analysis | Disaster Management, Public Services | Proactive risk mitigation, enhanced emergency response, reduced property damage 13 |

### **6\. The Economic Landscape and Future Outlook**

The African Earth Observation market is poised for significant growth, driven by the increasing adoption of EO applications in key sectors. The market size is estimated at 76.69 million USD in 2025 and is projected to grow to 111.53 million USD by 2030, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.78%.9 This growth is fueled by government support, with agencies providing aid and private sector players adopting EO solutions for purposes such as disaster management and agriculture.9

The business and funding models within the ecosystem are evolving. The market is driven by both public funding, often from national budgets and international partnerships, and private investment.24 While African governments allocated over 425 million USD to space activities in 2023, budget fluctuations and a continued reliance on foreign sources for large-scale projects remain a factor.24 A significant development is the emergence of the "as-a-service" business model, which offers flexible and cost-effective access to space-related services, resources, and technologies.24 This model is fundamentally shifting the financial landscape of the EO value stream. Instead of requiring large, one-time capital expenditures (Capex) to build physical infrastructure, organizations can now opt for more manageable, ongoing operational expenditures (Opex) by subscribing to cloud-based platforms and services.24 This lowers the financial barrier to entry for many African nations and private sector entities, making EO solutions more economically viable and scalable.

Despite this progress, challenges remain. The reliance on international partnerships, while strategic, also carries dependencies. Continued capacity building is essential to bridge the technical expertise gap.2 Furthermore, policy harmonization and intra-African collaboration are necessary to ensure that the benefits of EO are accessible and equitably distributed across the continent.2 The future of the African EO value stream will be defined by its ability to continue addressing these barriers through targeted investments in digital infrastructure, the fostering of public-private partnerships, and the promotion of ethical governance frameworks to ensure the responsible and sustainable use of this transformative technology.

### **7\. Conclusion: Unlocking the Continent's Potential**

The Earth Observation value stream in Africa is a dynamic ecosystem that is effectively leveraging technology to overcome developmental challenges and drive economic growth. The analysis of this stream, from upstream data acquisition to downstream value realization, reveals a narrative of strategic innovation and pragmatic collaboration. African nations have successfully adopted a "build and complement" strategy, combining indigenous satellite development with the intelligent and low-cost utilization of international open data. The most critical shift has been in the midstream, where platforms like Digital Earth Africa and Dunia are directly addressing the data-to-information gap by providing analysis-ready data and cloud-based tools, thereby democratizing access and lowering the barriers of cost and technical complexity.

The ultimate value of these efforts is overwhelmingly realized in the downstream applications, where EO data informs critical decisions in agriculture, water management, urban planning, and disaster response. The eThekwini GeoAI case study, for instance, highlights that the full realization of this value is contingent on addressing not just technical challenges but also the complex ethical and social dimensions of technology deployment. The market's growth is supported by a shift from large capital expenditures to the more accessible "as-a-service" model.

To fully unlock the continent’s potential, continued investment must be targeted at fostering this integrated ecosystem. This includes strengthening national and regional coordination bodies like AfriGEO, expanding digital infrastructure and ground stations, and harmonizing policies to ensure equitable access and responsible use. By doing so, Africa can build a resilient, self-sufficient, and innovative EO ecosystem that will be instrumental in achieving the shared prosperity and well-being envisioned in Agenda 2063\.
