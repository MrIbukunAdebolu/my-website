## 🚀 Look Up! An African Is Going to Space, and That African Could Be **You.**

Remember those childhood dreams? The ones where you looked up at the stars and wondered what it felt like to float among them? For decades, that dream felt impossible, a story reserved for government astronauts or billionaires. If you were from Africa, it felt even further out of reach—a club you weren't invited to join.

**Well, that rule book is being ripped up.**

The space race just got a massive upgrade, and this time, the ticket is going to an everyday person. Specifically, **a Nigerian civilian is about to be seated on a rocket**, shattering old barriers and making history for the entire continent.

### The Big Idea: Sending Regular People to the Stars

This incredible opportunity is thanks to the **Space Exploration and Research Agency (SERA)**. Their mission is beautifully simple: stop keeping space exploration locked up and start sharing it with the world.

SERA has partnered with Blue Origin, reserving seats on the New Shepard rocket for people like you and me. But here’s the best part: they aren't using a committee of elites to pick the winner. For the Nigerian flight, **the entire nation gets to decide** who gets to represent them above the Kármán line.

This isn't just a fun trip; it’s a seismic event for the continent. As Nigerian space lawyer Dr. Ani Agi wisely points out, the man or woman who takes that seat will become a figure the entire nation will look up to—**a legend in the making.**

### Why This Matters: The View That Changes Everything

What happens when a regular person—not a career astronaut—goes to space? They come back profoundly changed.

Just look at **Victor Espana, a regular guy from Brazil** who was SERA's first sponsored civilian. He had zero space background. He simply took a chance. When Victor returned, he didn't just bring back photos; he brought back a whole new life. The experience was so powerful he left his old job and now works in the space industry, dedicating himself to making this mission possible for the next person.

That’s the core of SERA’s mission. A scientist brings back data, but a civilian brings back a **story**. A story that reaches every young person back home, whispering, *"If he/she can do it, I can, too."*

### Take the Leap. The Stars Are Waiting.
