    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      We are a global consultancy at the intersection of space systems engineering, climate resilience, 
      and planetary health. Our team brings together deep expertise in aerospace design, geospatial 
      intelligence, and environmental health to solve complex challenges using space-based technologies 
      and data science.
    </p>

    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>
      To empower governments, research institutions, and private enterprises with innovative, 
      data-driven solutions that leverage satellite systems and Earth observation for sustainable 
      development, public health, and climate adaptation.
    </p>

    <h3>What We Do</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Satellite Systems Engineering:</strong> We design, test, and deploy CubeSats and microsatellites 
        for scientific, commercial, and educational missions. Our work includes structural integration, 
        thermal diagnostics, and deorbiting mechanisms for low Earth orbit platforms.</li>
      <li><strong>Climate & Environmental Intelligence:</strong> We apply remote sensing and GIS to assess 
        coastal vulnerability, urban heat islands, and flood risks. Our models have informed climate 
        adaptation strategies across West Africa and beyond.</li>
      <li><strong>Planetary Health & Data Science:</strong> We integrate AI, geospatial analytics, and 
        epidemiological modeling to forecast disease outbreaks, assess air quality impacts, and guide 
        climate-smart public health systems.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Our Research Impact</h3>
    <p>
      Our team has contributed extensively to the global body of knowledge through peer-reviewed 
      publications, technical reports, and collaborative research. These works span:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Satellite mission design and qualification, including CubeSat platforms and microsatellite bus systems.</li>
      <li>Geospatial modeling for climate risk assessment, with applications in agriculture, urban planning, 
        and disaster management.</li>
      <li>Environmental health analytics, focusing on the intersection of climate change, air quality, 
        and infectious disease dynamics.</li>
      <li>AI-driven decision support tools, integrating Earth observation data with public health and 
        environmental metrics.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These publications have been featured in leading scientific journals and presented at international 
      conferences, reflecting our commitment to rigorous, impactful, and ethically grounded research.
    </p>

    <h3>Global Reach</h3>
    <p>
      With experience spanning Africa, Asia, and North America, we collaborate with universities, 
      space agencies, and public health institutions to deliver solutions that are scientifically 
      rigorous and socially impactful.
